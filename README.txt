Foresight
Leif Lindquist

Foresight is a calendar and task management web application. Users can schedule tasks on desired dates which will be tied to those dates in the calendar portion.
The project contains multiple funcions for manipulating the calendar and the user's view. Through a series of menus, users can schedule a task on a selected date, giving it a
name, start date, and end date. These events are stored locally as a JSON file, which is automatically created and retrieved by the program as necessary. User data is also saved automatically after certain
operations have been performed.

This project was build using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No additional libraries, DLLs, or external files were used. This is vanilla JavaScript.

To run the file, the user needs a web browser compatible with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Functionally, this will be most any modern browser. Windows Edge is reccomneded, as it was the web browser
the project was build and tested with. In order to launch the web application, the user simply needs to open the HTML file with their web browser. For Windows devices, this should be as simple as double-clicking
the file and choosing their desired application to open it with. The CSS and JavaScript will be loaded automatically by the HTML file, provided the files are all in the same directory.

The project is not complete, but will receive some work in the future. At current, the core functionality is working. Users can navigate the calendar, all visual elements function correctly, and the user can
check, add, and delete tasks from calendar days. Adding multiple tasks to a day works fine, but deleting tasks from a day with multiple tasks sometimes has unforseen consequences.
At current, the project demonstrates architectural requirements defined when development began. This includes: data storage, validation and verification, reusable code, and in-code documentation.

In order to verify you have all the necessary files, check to ensure these three files are present and in the same directory:
index.html
script.js
style.css

Re-naming these files or failing to place them in the same directory will cause the application to work in unintended ways.
